# Resources

Simple quantities that are produced or consumed.  On object in the world may be represented in multiple ways,
but the 'resource' concepts is only used to represent economics and logistics.

### mass vs volume
Units:  Resources are represented by MKS metric units:   meter-kilogram-second.   Mass is therefore kilograms and
volume is meters-cubed.

### density:
  
Density is commonly expressed in grams / milliliter == gram/cc. 

For instance:
1. Money (credits) is used purely as a resource.   It cannot do anything besides exchange for other resources.
2. Gasoline exist in the game world, as a gathered resource, but it isn't useful until it's exchanged either for 
   money, or for motion (in a piston engine) or for electricity (in a generator).
3. A generator is both a resource and a module.
   a. It is produced as a resource, and tracked as a resource.  
   b. A generator can be installed.   This consumes a generator-resource and produces a generator module.




# Process

Defines how resources are exchanged for each other.


# Module

Defines machinery that can run one or more processes.
